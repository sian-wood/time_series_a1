Should I be truncating the data? removing a section? Should I be using a method to determine which section to remove? It doesn't make a major difference to the stationarity/differencing. 

Should I be using any statistic to determine whether a time series is or is not stationary, or is a visual inspection of the time plot and acf sufficient?
